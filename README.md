You can find the data used for the creation of networks under "data/datasets/"

Our data was collected using the Scopus API, and labeled using a mix of Claude 3.5 Haiku and ourselves. We use NER to extract the organizations for each row in the dataset, and we use networkx and Gephi to build the networks.

More to come in later commit
